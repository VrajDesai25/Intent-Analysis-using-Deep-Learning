A simple project which involves finding intent behind comments from a user and providing the user with the intent classfication of their comment and correspondingly taking them to a website of their needs.<br />
For more information, check out my paper based on this project - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343151165_Text-Based_Intent_Analysis_using_Deep_Learning <br />
The final output of the project is directing the user to a website on the basis of their intents. For example: If the intent behind a user's comment is 'Food', the user will be directed to Zomato website.<br />
